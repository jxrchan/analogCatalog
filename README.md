# ANALOG CATALOG

**ANALOG CATALOG** (although I would have preferred "Analogue Catalogue" because British English) is targeted at record enthusiasts looking to catalogue and value their vinyl collections. The application was designed in React.js and completed as a professional course project. It uses the open-source DiscogsÂ© webAPI, fetching data from Discogs' database and marketplace to present consolidated information about your records.

## Background

Discogs is the largest community-driven online database and marketplace for all things vinyl. Users can discover new artists and albums, or purchase rare vinyls from their favourite artists. Think of Discogs as a Carousell except it's more international and just for physical music.

As a vinyl collector myself, I have relied on maintaining an Excel sheet to keep track of the music I own. That has, however, been laborious as I have had to key individual details of each record.

I recently learnt that Discogs provided a free-to-use WebAPI (Application Programming Interface) for developers to access their database. And so, I embarked on the Analog Catalog project. Using my recently acquired skills in React.js and API calls, I looked to design a simple application, allowing users to tap into Discogs' database and marketplace to maintain their own electronic database with simple clicks.

No more of that weary Excel crunching!

### Setting Up Guide

1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jxrchan/analogCatalog
    ```

2. Navigate to the root directory

    ```bash
    cd ./analogCatalog
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file within the root

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

4. Add the following environmental variables inside the `.env` file

    ```bash
    VITE_DISCOGS_API
    VITE_CONSUMER_KEY
    VITE_CONSUMER_SECRET
    VITE_AIRTABLE_TOKEN
    ```

5. Install Dependencies

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

    ```bash
    npm i react-router-dom@6
    ```

6. Start the Development Server

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7. Access the Application

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Application Interface

<img src="./images/login_page.png">

The application begins with a login page which currently has no implemented authentication logic.

*Username is stored in a state which is then passed into the Airtable. It is used as a unique identifier to display the user's custom records.*

<img src="./images/search_page.png">

Search records at the Home page using any combination of artist name, record title, and format. Hover over your record of interest and click on add to collection or wishlist. Navigate to previous and next search results using the link at the bottom of the page.

*This page uses the search endpoint of Discogs' API. I have currently limited the fetch query to display 15 results per page.*

The collection pages display two lists: "My Collection" and "My Wishlist," which populate based on your actions on the Home page. Further information, including genres and current marketplace price (unfortunately only USD at this point) for your selected records, is automatically stored in this table.

The 'More' button navigates to Discogs' webpage for the record. The 'Update' button allows users to input more information about their collected record. The 'Delete' button removes a record from the database.

*This page uses the 'Release' endpoint of Discogs' API to fetch further details about records of interest that were not in the 'Search' endpoint. Updating and deleting records work through Airtable's API.*

## Next Steps

Future iterations of the project may include the following:

- Use of a real-time currency conversion API to convert Discogs' marketplace prices to user's currency of choice.
- Sorting functions within My Collection and My Wishlist.
- Proper username and password authentication with back-end validation.
