        Analog Catalog is targeted at record enthusiasts
        looking to catalogue and value their vinyl collections. The application
        was designed in React.js and completed as a professional course project.
        It uses the open-source DiscogsÂ© webAPI, fetching data from Discog's
        database and marketplace to present consolidated information about your
        records.
